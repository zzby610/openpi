"""
Iterates through the DROID dataset and creates a json mapping from episode unique IDs to ranges of time steps
that should be sampled during training (all others are filtered out).

Filtering logic:
We look for ranges of consecutive steps that contain at most min_idle_len consecutive idle frames
(default to 7 -- as most DROID action-chunking policies run the first 8 actions generated in each chunk, filtering
this way means the policy will not get stuck outputting stationary actions). Additionally, we also only keep non-idle
ranges of length at least min_non_idle_len (default to 16 frames = ~1 second), while also removing the last
filter_last_n_in_ranges frames from the end of each range (as those all correspond to action chunks with many idle actions).

This leaves us with trajectory segments consisting of contiguous, significant movement. Training on this filtered set
yields policies that output fewer stationary actions (i.e., get "stuck" in states less).
